# Tetanus

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description

After struggling to pick up the programming languages that I wanted to learn, I discovered how developing actual projects gave me a new and exciting incentive to study, and allowed me to understand how programming languages work. I began with UtiliT, which is available on my profile (danielteberian/UtiliT), but is probably going to be archived in the coming weeks. I realized that C is not too popular for what I was trying to do, so I did some research, discovered Rust, and I began to work on rewriting UtiliT, while improving its performance, compatibility, and features.

As far as being a 1:1 remastering of my previous project, this repository leaves a lot to be desired. I am working on rewriting the tools that I had written for UtiliT, and I have begun planning out the features and improvements that I will add to Tetanus, and getting the features that I had in UtiliT is a pretty high priority.

If you know of any tools that I could learn from, start an issue, and tell me all about your knowledge. :)

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

While most of Tetanus' utilities can be used without any dependencies (other than Rust/Cargo), in order to use all of Tetanus' utilities, you need to have the following installed:

* ncurses

### Installing

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory that you have downloaded/cloned this repository to.
3. If you downloaded this repository, you need to decompress the archive. If you cloned this repository, you can navigate to Tetanus' directory without doing anything else.
4. When you are in the root directory of Tetanus, type "cargo build" to compile Tetanus.
5. As soon as Tetanus finishes compiling, the binaries can be found in target/debug.
